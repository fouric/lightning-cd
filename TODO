Implement scrolling/paging for large directory listings
Implement vertical scrolling for normal mode
Consider fuzzy search or rankings in terms of string length
Color (using mimetypes)?
Separate files and directories in listings
Use mimetype command to use appropriate command for opening files
Rearrange hidden files so that they are intermingled with normal files (for non-dotfiles such as fasls)
Design and implement glass mode
Make searching in large directories easier by only subselecting out of already selected files
Absorb excess keystrokes before quitting

BUGFIX: exec'ing to a process and then using another Lightning instance will cause the exec'd instance to cd to the wrong directory. Fix or edge case? Solution: Use a directory-stack-based dirwrite file.
