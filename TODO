Implement scrolling/paging for large directory listings
Implement vertical scrolling for normal mode
Consider fuzzy search or rankings in terms of string length
Color (using mimetypes)?
Rearrange hidden files so that they are intermingled with normal files (for non-dotfiles such as fasls)
Just throw all pretense of modularity to the wind and make the entire thing a big state machine
Add a preview pane when in select mode (thanks to Mithaldu on HN)

BUGFIX: exec'ing to a process and then using another Lightning instance will cause the exec'd instance to cd to the wrong directory. Fix or edge case? Solution: Use a directory-stack-based dirwrite file.
