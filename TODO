Implement scrolling for large directory listings
Make actions on multiple selections more useful (e.g., allow you to j and k through multiple selections, then search, etc. using space to break)
Add the ability to enter other characters such as periods
Consider fuzzy search or rankings in terms of string length
Add slashes to end of directory listings
Color?
Either allow for uppercase or treat stuff as being case-insensitive (case-variants of stuff will allow you to page or something like that)
