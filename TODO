Implement scrolling/paging for large directory listings
Implement horizontal scrolling for normal mode
Consider fuzzy search or rankings in terms of string length
Color (using mimetypes)?
Rearrange hidden files so that they are intermingled with normal files (for non-dotfiles such as fasls)
Make searching in large directories easier by only subselecting out of already selected files
Add a preview pane when in select mode (thanks to Mithaldu on HN)
Prefilter directory listings for directions immediately connected to the current one

BUGFIX: exec'ing to a process and then using another Lightning instance will cause the exec'd instance to cd to the wrong directory. Fix or edge case? Solution: Use a directory-stack-based dirwrite file.
